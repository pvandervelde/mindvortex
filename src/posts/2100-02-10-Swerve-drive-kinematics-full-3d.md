- Swerve drive kinematics for uneven and outdoor environments

- As I'm interested in outdoor mobile robots eventually I'll have to deal with uneven surfaces,
  wheel slip and wheel lift-off. And robots that move around in a 3D world and have
  suspension.
    + For these cases you need a more advanced algorithm than the one I have used.
      Neal Seegmiller has developed one such algorithm that will be implemented
      in a later stage.
