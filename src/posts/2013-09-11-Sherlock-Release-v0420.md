Version [V0.4.2.0](https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/releases/tag/v0.4.2.0) of the [Sherlock](/projects/sherlock.html) regression testing application has been released. This release adds one bug fix and one improvement.

The bug fix is a change to the `IsHyperVMachine` and `IsPhysicalMachine` stored procedures in order to make them easier to use correctly.

The improvement is the addition of build steps that package the web projects into a ZIP file for easier deployment. These zip files can now also be retrieved from the [release note](https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/releases/tag/v0.4.2.0)
