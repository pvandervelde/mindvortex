- Currently implementing a [simple kinematics approach](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/paper-4-wheel-independent-drive-independent-steering-swerve/107383).


SHOW DIAGRAM OF THE MODEL

- Explain math for forward and inverse kinematics


- Assumptions
    + The robot is moving on a flat, horizontal surface
    + The robot has no suspension
    + There is no wheel slip
    + There is no wheel lift-off
    + The motors are infinitely powerful and fast, i.e. there are no limits on the motor performance,
      so we can ignore them
    + All movements take the same amount of time (1 unit of time)
