Title: Technical Debt - part 2 - Thoughts

- Agile / Scrum is good for progress in projects that have been going for ages and don't
  change on a fundamental level
  - Bad for long term issues like architecture because the process is short term focussed
  - Leads to tech debt, because tech debt generally isn't on the product owners wish list
- Don't pick up approaches because they work at other companies, they might not work for you.
  figure out what the reason is they work. Generally it will be a philosophy (e.g. be agile, which
  isn't the same as using agile).
  - Note that following the philosophy often requires that management give up a lot of
    'power' because that 'power' needs to be given to the teams doing the work

- MVP are similar to scrum, great for the intial project, but not great for additions to a
  project. Often used to do an internal thing, making it just about work and then moving on.
  This leads to half completed projects which then later on are replaced or need serious
  upgrades

- Technical strategy
  - Detailed generally doesn't seem sensible
  - Maybe it should be more like a route

- When working on improvements to delivery / bug numbers etc. keep in mind that you may need to change
  not just the technical teams but also the management, sales and support teams. If they keep doing what
  they were doing then you are going to get the same results
