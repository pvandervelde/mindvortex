In my last two posts I talked about different control methods for a swerve drive robot. One method
controls the movement of drive modules directly and another aimed to controls the movement of
the drive modules by



- In order to better understand what is actually happening with the robot and the drive modules while
  moving I wanted to create some animations
- Made some for module control (as described [here](posts/Swerve-drive-kinematics-simulation)) and
  some for body control (as described [here](posts/Swerve-drive-body-focussed-control))
- These animations make it a lot more clear what is actually going on and show clearly how well
  (or not well) the drive modules are synchronised in the different control approaches
- I've also added some graphs showing the velocities, accelerations and [jerk]() of the
  robot body and the drive modules
- Have done so for the 45 degree linear movement into a rotation
