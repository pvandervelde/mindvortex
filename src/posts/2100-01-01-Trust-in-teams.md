* Teams need to be able to trust each other
* Teams also need to trust their lead / manager - Don't throw the team under the bus
* Teams need to trust upper management. If it looks like management doesn't care about the things
  they say they care about, then trust will be eroded
  * Be consistent in the message and then follow the message. If the company claims to care about
    quality then you need to actually care about quality. If features always have right of way over
    quality, then you don't actually care about quality
* Loyalty is generally not to a company, but to coworkers. When they leave then the loyalty
  goes
  * Also the local culture of the team / local leads



* The value for most / all tech companies is in what their people know
  * losing somebody is far more of a loss that most companies think
    * Lose a person doing work
    * Lose a bunch of knowledge that is only in their heads
    * Need to train a new person
* Tech companies automate business knowledge which means that the dev teams
  has that knowledge in their heads
