- Learning to drive Scuttle with ROS
- First doing this virtually via Gazebo and RViz so that we leave out the physical hardware issues
- Lots of bits for Scuttle ROS already done
- Used teleop keyboard

Lessons learned

- Configuration that describes the robot. There are many parts and some information is duplicated
  - Gazebo has information about the drive system, so does the navigation stack
