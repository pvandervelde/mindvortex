Title: Starting robotics - The Why?

- Decided that I need to do some engineering that isn't just software. Something you can touch and see, but with
  some coding.
- Been working on software for about 14 years now (longer if you count the PhD). And all of it has been virtual
- Feeling that I lost touch with my engineering background (studied Aerospace engineering) and the limitations and
  opportunities that being in a physical problem space offers
- Wanted to work with my hands, building things
- So decided to look into robotics which is a combination of many things, structures, electronics (which I know
  nothing about), software, perception etc. etc.
- Current goal is to eventually build an autonomous mobile robot that can carry things around outdoors.
- Aiming to make it a swerve drive as part of the challenge and the opportunities it offers
