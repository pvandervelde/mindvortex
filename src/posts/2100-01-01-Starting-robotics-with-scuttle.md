Title: Starting robotics with the SCUTTLE robot

- Could build something myself but for those first quick wins (and thus the desire to continue)
  it might be better to get something that has been tested and then buy that.
- Decided to buy the SCUTTLE robot kit
- Tinkering set-up, not a closed system
- Capable of actually carrying a load. Most robot kits are fun platforms to play with but other
  than driving around they're not actually very useful. I want my robot to be able to do stuff,
  to carry things for me.
- Lots of excellent support on the SCUTTLE discord
- Comes with sample code and excellent documentation
- Affordable, and extendable
- Got it to drive with the gamepad
- Got it to (badly) follow a coloured object
  - Note that the badly bit is totally my own fault.
  - The colour of the object didn't stand out very much
  - The environment was dark (it was evening)
- Planning to use SCUTTLE as a way to learn new things in robotics and eventually build my own
  from scratch
- Every robot is different even if they're the same design because the hardware is all slightly different
  e.g. motors that aren't exactly the same

- Interested in doing a outdoor swerve system and working out the navigation etc for that
