- One of the encoders on SCUTTLE has gone bad, probably because I broke it
- Showed weird behaviour when testing the bumper code on scuttle
- Running a test with the encoder python code to get the numbers

PICTURE OF THE SCATTER

- Possible reasons for not working (distance from sensor, broken sensor)
  - Measuring the brackets
    - Possible need to sand the contact surfaces on the bracket
- Replace it with a new encoder
  - Encoder type + specs
  - Soldering the header pins

- Adding back to scuttle

- Testing the encoder
