Version [V0.4.6.0](https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/releases/tag/v0.4.6.0) of the [Sherlock](/projects/sherlock.html) regression testing application has been released. This release provides two bug fixes:

* The MSI installer now verifies that all directories exist before writing to them ([issue #9](https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/issues/9))
* The X-copy installer now verifies that the destination directory exists before copying files to it ([issue #10](https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/issues/10))
