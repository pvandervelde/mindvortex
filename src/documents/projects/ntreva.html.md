[nTreva](http://pvandervelde.github.io/nTreva) is an application that creates an XML file containing license information from installed NuGet packages. nTreva outputs a file containing information about the installed packages (found in the different package.config files), their project URL and their license URL. If no project or license URL is found a default google search URL is generated.
