* Lots of wind. Just short of not being flyable.
* Did 4 flights of about 25 mins each.
* Did a 360 turn after getting lots of height. Strange feeling as the down wind section of the turn is much larger than the upwind part. At the end of the turn it sort of feels like you snap in place.
* Messed up start on second one, got picked up and glider overshot. Eva taught me how to do sideways launch where you lay the glider out at an angle and pull one end up first. Seems to generate less pull and is relatively easy to control. Unlike the reverse launch however you need to be much more agressive in pulling up the glider because if you are not, you give the low side time to catch up (which is not what you want). In fact you want the whole thing to come up on an angle so that you can control the inflation speed. 
* Flew back from the launch site to the car park (about 6 or so km's)
* On 20 flights now :)
