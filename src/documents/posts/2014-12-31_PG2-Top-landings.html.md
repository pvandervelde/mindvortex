* Flying once again at Maioro
* Quite windy. Started off with not much wind, but enough to soar. Got stronger in the afternoon
* Got two long 40 - 45 min flights in. First one was a bit of scratching but still staying up there. Second one was easy to stay up, but kinda rumbly
* Did two top landings. Although the first one was more of a top crash. tried to slow down and turn at the same time, which made the glider do neither. Wasn't turned into the wind enough to slow it down. In top landing everything happens very fast. The second top landing was better in that I didn't crash but still hard. Came in quite high. Got out of harness too early, hence lost weight shift powers, harder to turn. Had to fly S-turns over landing area which has nasty bushes on both sides. Lots of lift all around the place. Eventually managed to work my way down.
* Flew back to the car (6 km flight). Didn't really have to turn, just follow the ridges and I had enough height.
* All bottom landings (3) were not quite in the spot where I wanted to land. Got to work on my landings.
