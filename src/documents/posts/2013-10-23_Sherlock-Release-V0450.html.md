Version [V0.4.5.0](https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/releases/tag/v0.4.5.0) of the [Sherlock](/projects/sherlock.html) regression testing application has been released. This release provides one improvement and one bug fix:

* The test report can now include files generated during the test ([issue #5](https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/issues/5))
* Sherlock.Service no longer includes a manifest signing key, instead the key is obtained via a configuration setting ([issue #8](https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/issues/8))
