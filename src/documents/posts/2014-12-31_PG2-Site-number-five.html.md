* Flew at Mangawhai heads as my fifth site
* Launch location is super small. Just big enough for a glider
* Decent amount of wind, easy to soar but on the limit of what is possible
* Did forward launch with assistence. Pretty much got catapulted of the launch
* Line tangle at the top C/D line. 
* Harness set up much improved after some tweaking. Will have to make some longer flights to determine if all the settings are correct.
* Thinking I should start practising my high wind asymmetrical launches
* Have a stir-up on the harness now and that makes a big difference. Super easy to get into the harness with that.
