* Sat 8 - 02
* Flight number 40 was 1:15 hours long, with a nice asymmetric launch and a top landing.
* Did 2 more flights. Didn't manage to top land on either. First one I put myself in a bad spot and then dropped to low to get back to the ridge. Did manage to land in the spot I pre-selected. Second one it got too busy on the launch / was way windy / I was being a wimp
* Also did my VFR exam which I passed
* Getting close to completing all the requirements, now all I have to do is convince the instructors I'm good enough to fly by myself


Need to:
* Practise top landings more. Got one which is good but will need heaps more work
* More asymmetric launch practise
