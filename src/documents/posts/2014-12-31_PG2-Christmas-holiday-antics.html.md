* Only got a fly two days due to rain and lots of high wind days
* Flew at Maoiro and Maori bay
* Got my own harness (Kortel Karma II). So excited about that. Heaps of stuff to set-up correctly, the damn thing has straps for Africa and adjustments in places where I don't have places. Will be a while before I get it to be all good.
* New harness is harder to get into than the school ones (at least so far). And very sensitive to weight shift. Pretty comfy though :)
* Did my PG2 theory exam and got 97 out of a 100 score. Pretty happy with that. Still need to do the air law exam though, that's going to be less entertaining.
