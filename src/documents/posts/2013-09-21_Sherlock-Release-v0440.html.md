Version [V0.4.4.0](https://github.com/pvandervelde/Sherlock/releases/tag/v0.4.4.0) of the [Sherlock](/projects/sherlock.html) regression testing application has been released. This release provides two improvements:

* The test output now includes an XML report with all the messages and an indication of test success or failure.
* Removed the Test data directory settings from the web service because test packages are now always dropped in the App_Data directory
