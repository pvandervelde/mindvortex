### Who

Patrick van der Velde. Online mostly written as Petrik.

### What

Studied [aerodynamics](http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/en/) and subsequently completed a PhD in [mechanical engineering](http://www.mech.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/) writing software
sprinkled with some [computational fluid dynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) and optimization calculations.

Commercial software developer since 2008. Worked on projects in C#, Delphi and C++. Miles more skilled in C# than the other languages. As a bonus has a pet hate for C++.

### When

Some things since birth, other things since a varying point in time since birth. 


### Why

In general, and depending on the context, because I can, or because it's there. Pick one.


### And finally

There is so much more to explore here, so do take a look. 

* Some (open source) [projects](/projects.html).
* Some random [posts](/index.html) about software, climbing and flying.
