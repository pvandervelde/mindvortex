[nAdoni](https://github.com/pvandervelde/nAdoni) is a library that provides a way to check for updates to one or more binaries via an update manifest, and then to download an archive containing the updated binaries.

The manifest file is an XML file which is signed with an RSA key to provide some form of security in the update process.
