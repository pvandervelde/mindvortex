[Calvinverse](https://github.com/Calvinverse) contains the scripts and tools that I use to create and learn about building 'immutable' build infrastructure on both Azure and Hyper-V.
The repositories have code for creating Hyper-V and Azure base images and the configuration scripts containing the specific configurations for my internal server.
