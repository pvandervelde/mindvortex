Apollo is the code name for an application that provides engineering and design simulation capabilities, e.g. [fluid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics), [structural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_mechanics) or [optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_optimization) calculations, for users who aren't highly skilled in the use of modern day simulation tools. The goal for Apollo is to provide the users with a high level abstraction of the simulation so that they can focus on the engineering design while the software handles the underlying simulation details.

Apollo will not provide any geometry manipulation capabilities from itself, but it will instead by tightly integrated into one or more [CAD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) applications so that users can execute simulations directly from their CAD applications. For starters Apollo will only be integrated with [Rhino 3D](http://www.rhino3d.com/).

To allow users to run large computations the application is capable of distributing the processing over multiple CPU cores and onto other computers on the local network.
